# Map Lens

Map Lens is a sample JavaScript-based web application that demonstrates lensing or perhaps a better description is "draggable map insets".  Lensing offers many benefits over traditional swiping which is commonly used to horizontally transition between two web maps, for example, before and after a hurricane imagery.  In comparison, lensing offers the user an unlimited number of rectangular map overlays, for example, one lens per Esri basemap as shown above.
